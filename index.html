        <h2>About Hepta</h2>
        <p>
            Hepta is an advanced penetration tester and ethical hacker who is well respect
            in the cybersecurity community. His work focuses on identifying vulnerabilities
            in systems before malicious attackers can exploit them.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I admire most about Hepta is his deep technical knowledge and his commitment
            to ethical hacking practices. He demonstrates how system can be hacked via simple vulnerabilities
            found in systems and how we can exploit them (through hack the box or try hack me challenges).
